# Project Overview 

We created a webpage and a dynamic table to provide an overall analysis of UFO sightings to filter by date. For this project, we will go one step further and provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time by adding table filters for:

- city
- state
- country 
- shape

## Deliverable 1: Creating Filters for Multiple Criteria 

To start off, we modified our existing code to adding more table filters. We used JavaScript to create new functions that save the element, value and ID of the filter that was changed. Then, we created a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria.

## Results 

With our modified webpage, individuals are able to get extremely concise with the information they would like to retrieve from the data. By adding search fields as in state, country, date and shape, we've allowed for an in-depth analysis on the UFO sightings pulled from our data.

If we would like to search by "shape," then we will see that the table will show the reported sightings for any UFOs that appear to be triangle in shape.

## Summary 

Cons:

- We have no button to click once we enter all the search fields we'd like 
- As we worked with JavaScript, the search field is very case sensitive and won't pull any information if you do not enter the data as how it depicts in the search box. 

Recommendations: 

- Adding drop-down menus and a table of contents for the website would allow the overall webpage to be organized on the reader's eyes as well as easier to navigate.
- Having a button added on the search box would be ideal for a cohesive user experience.
